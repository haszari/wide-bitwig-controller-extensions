# wide-bitwig-controller-extensions
Bitwig controller scripts for live performance on multiple tracks at once.

Most controller extensions are focused on a single channel at a time, 
with deep control of all devices in the channel.

This repo takes a different approach. The goal is to maximise the 
control of multiple channels at once.

Each channel has one or more macro parameters mapped automatically (depending 
on the layout of the controller), so you can tweak synth params across many 
instruments.

I'm betting that's more fun!
